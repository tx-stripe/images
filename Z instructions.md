Build me a storefront selling cookies with integrated stripe payments. Make sure to use stripe as the source of truth for my business, including products, customers and orders. Make sure to customer_creation='always' during the checkout to make sure customer objects are always created. 

Do not create users or orders table in my database. Instead rely on the sync stripe customers and charges table as my source of truth.
